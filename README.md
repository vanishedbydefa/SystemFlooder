# SystemFlooder
Configurable Executable to flood a system with predefined media.

## Usage
Because this Software is kinda complex and shouldn't be used without respecting the work, the access is restricted.
There are two options to use it. Both are listed below. Please note: This software isn't free because it is and can be used by goddesses to gain money from subs. As I have costs to cover for the development, I try to get a share with this approach.

### Option 1 - Buy configured SystemFlooder executable

LICENSE: You are allowed to use the bought executable. You are not allowed to share it or even sell it. In case activities like this are notice by the vendor, your executable will be deactivated.

### Option 2 -  Buy configurable executable
If you want to personalize SystemFlooder e.g. if you want to use it for "customers", you can get a personalized executable that can be configured at any time by you. Therefor, you will need to follow the [config setup](https://github.com/vanishedbydefa/SystemFlooder/blob/main/config.md). With this option, you also get technical support for the configuration and so on.
